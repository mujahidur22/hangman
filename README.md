# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

In order to start the game, download the file milestone_5.py to your local repository. Run python mileston_5.py and start guessing!

You will only be able to guess 1 letter at a time. Any other inputs will not be allowed. Each correct input will be stored.

Keep guessing until you've got it right or run out of lives.
